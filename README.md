## About
In this Spotify Clone, I use next js v12, tailwind, next js middleware, typescript, next auth, redux toolkit, and the important part is using Spotify API for getting user information.
This project can show your playlists on Spotify and play themes for the 30s.
You can handle the volume and time of the track that plays.
